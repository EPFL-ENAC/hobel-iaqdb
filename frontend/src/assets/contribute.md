The database collects all types of air pollutant concentration data measured in the year 2000 or later, along with metadata related to the building, space, mechanical systems, occupancy, indoor sources, and instruments.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to our database is straightforward and secure. Please follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Metadata**: Please prepare notes, reports, or publications that contain information about your study, buildings, their mechanical systems (if applicable), and instrumentation. Such data will be collected to help end users explore relevant research questions.

2. **Organize Your IAQ Data**: We strongly encourage that IAQ data are stored in the true long format, including four columns of data (Timestamp, Parameter, Value, and Unit) and three columns of identifiers (Building_ID, Space_ID, and Instrument_ID, with the first two being mandatory). We will accept other data formats as long as such information is complete and easily identifiable.

3. **Licensing**: We kindly ask you to agree to the [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/). The PDDL dedicates a database to the public domain, allowing anyone to use, modify, and share the data without any restrictions - including for commercial and AI training purposes. It is similar in spirit to Creative Commons CC0, but tailored for structured databases.

See detailed [guidelines for contributing data](/Data_preperation_and_contribution_instructions_20250605.pdf) to ensure your data is formatted correctly and meets our requirements.

## Recognition and Benefits for Contributors

We value your contribution and aim to recognize it meaningfully:

* **Early Access**: Contributors will receive **exclusive access to the full database prior to public release**. The level of early access may vary based on the size of your contribution.

* **Visibility and Impact**: Your data will be clearly attributed and made visible through a globally accessible platform. This increases the **reuse and citation** of your work and fosters further collaboration.

* **Authorship Opportunities**: Major contributors may be invited to **co-author the flagship publication** describing the database, its structure, and key findings. During subsequent data exploration phases, some contributors may receive invitations to **collaboratively explore compelling research questions** that emerge from the shared data. This enables co-authorship opportunities on follow-up scientific publications and ensures mutual benefit from joint intellectual input.

* **Contribution to the Field**: By contributing, you help advance indoor air quality science and support evidence-based policy, design, and research across sectors.
