The database collects all types of air pollutant concentration data measured in the year 2000 or later, along with metadata related to the building, space, mechanical systems, occupancy, indoor sources, and instruments.

## How to Contribute

Contributing to our database is straightforward and secure. Please follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Metadata**: Please prepare notes, reports, or publications that contain information about your study, buildings, their mechanical systems (if applicable), and instrumentation. Such data will be collected to help end users explore relevant research questions.

2. **Organize Your IAQ Data**: We strongly encourage that IAQ data are stored in the true long format, including four columns of data (Timestamp, Parameter, Value, and Unit) and three columns of identifiers (Building_ID, Space_ID, and Instrument_ID, with the first two being mandatory). We will accept other data formats as long as such information is complete and easily identifiable.

3. **Licensing**: We kindly ask you to agree to the [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/). The PDDL dedicates a database to the public domain, allowing anyone to use, modify, and share the data without any restrictions - including for commercial and AI training purposes. It is similar in spirit to Creative Commons CC0, but tailored for structured databases.

See detailed [guidelines for contributing data](/Data_preperation_and_contribution_instructions_20250605.pdf) to ensure your data is formatted correctly and meets our requirements.

## Recognition and Benefits for Contributors

We value your contribution and aim to recognize it meaningfully:

* **Early Access**: Contributors will receive exclusive access to the full database prior to public release.

* **Visibility and Impact**: Your data will be clearly attributed and made visible through a globally accessible platform. This increases the reuse and citation of your work and fosters further collaboration.

* **Co-Authorship Opportunities**: Contributors of major datasets may be invited to co-author the flagship publication describing the database, its structure, and key findings: some contributors may receive invitations to collaboratively explore compelling research questions that emerge from the contributed data. This enables co-authorship opportunities on follow-up scientific publications and ensures mutual benefit from joint intellectual input.

* **Contribution to the Field**: By contributing, you help advance indoor air quality science and support evidence-based policy, design, and research across sectors.

## Privacy, Licensing, Ethics, And Legal Considerations

We understand that questions about privacy, licensing, ethics, and legal responsibilities are essential, and we are committed to making the process transparent and secure. Below you'll find answers to the most common questions, in both short and expanded formats for clarity.

### Data License

By submitting data, contributors agree to the Open Data Commons PDDL, which dedicates the data to the public domain, allowing anyone to use, modify, and share it freely, including for commercial and AI training purposes. If a DOI or other permanent identifier to your original source is specified during data contribution, IAQ Database users are encouraged to cite the original source.

<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>

The open nature of the database, along with the acknowledgment of contributing work, fosters collaboration via reuse and citation. The [Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/)  is specifically designed for databases and ensures that your dataset is freely reusable by the public, including researchers, policymakers, companies, and the general public. It is equivalent in spirit to Creative Commons CC0 but better suited for structured datasets. Importantly, you retain authorship and acknowledgment of your work, made visible through this globally accessible platform and via Zenodo, which provide a citable DOI and reference to IAQ Database and your original source where available.

### Privacy and Ethical Assurance

The IAQ Database does **not collect any personal or sensitive data**. All contributed data must be de-identified before submission, keeping only data that is untraceable to individuals or to specific buildings.

<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>

Personal data means any information that can directly (e.g., name, address) or indirectly (e.g., combination of building coordinates, age group and socio-demographic profile) identify a person. This project does **not involve collection of personal or sensitive data**. Responsibility for compliance with Swiss and European data protection laws ([FADP](https://fedlex.data.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/491) and [GDPR](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj) respectively), as well as your local privacy and security laws (e.g., regarding military or residential buildings), lies with the contributor IAQ Database does not collect specific coordinates of buildings, and you can decide to specify the city or only the country where the building is located. Information about the source dataset, including contributor(s)’s name, contact email, institution/company, and related publication is for the sole purpose of making your dataset citable.

Data processing includes:

* Secure transfer of the dataset to EPFL servers
* Integration into the IAQ database
* Re-sharing of data points with users under PDDL
* Analysis and visualizations
* Preservation alongside the IAQ Database on Zenodo data repository
* Display of your authorship and data source

</details>

### Other Legal Considerations

There are no expected legal risks for contributors, provided they have the right to share the data and metadata. As contributors submit their data to IAQ Database, they should act in accordance with co-authors regarding the PDDL license release within the database and related Zenodo publication.

<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>

The data management team provides regular “snapshots” of the IAQ Database on Zenodo, where authors and persistent identifiers of the source work are referred. The PDDL license is carried over to the Zenodo publication, **Data contributors are responsible for confirming** that they have the rights to share the data under PDDL. If your dataset includes third-party data or was collected under restrictive agreements, please ensure that you have the appropriate permission or use our template documents to seek approval (see Q&A below).

</details>

### Sustainability

Funds are available to allow the IAQ Database to stay online at least until 2035. Moreover, the collected data are regularly published into Zenodo, making it citable and preserved for the long-term.

<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>

IAQ Database is maintained by the Human-Oriented Built Environment Lab (HOBEL) and ENAC IT4R at EPFL. Zenodo is funded by the European Commission and other major international partners: find more at [Zenodo infrastructure](https://about.zenodo.org/infrastructure). Every major version of the IAQ Database triggers a new version being deposited on Zenodo: it provides specific DOIs for each version, plus a general DOI always pointing to its last version. For each new version, authors and references (ex. DOIs) to contributed datasets are added. This makes the underlying data of the IAQ Database citable and provides more visibility to contributors’ work.

## Q&A for Data Contributors

<details>
  <summary>Read more</summary>

**What data should I contribute to IAQ Database?**

Each contributed dataset is made of Indoor Air Quality data plus accompanying metadata. We focus on **already published or publishable research-quality data**. Here you can find the list of collected indoor air quality data: [data schema](/Dictionary_data_v2_20250704.xlsx). Metadata should also be provided (e.g., information related to the study, building, space, mechanical system, and instrument) separately accompanying the indoor air quality data. You can find here the collected metadata: [metadata schema](/Dictionary_metadata_v2_20250710.xlsx).

**How do I know if I can share my data?**

If your data is already publicly available (e.g., via journal supplementary files, institutional repositories, or data repositories), and you are the author, you may submit it directly. If your data is unpublished, you can still contribute it by providing the required metadata and confirming data quality and authorship. If the data was collected under a project with external partners or funding, we recommend using the following template document to inform and seek approval from relevant parties:

➡️ Download: IAQ Database Explanation & Approval Request Template (available soon)

**What if my Data Management Plan currently does not allow data sharing?**

You may request to update your DMP. Many data management plans allow for updates or amendments to include data-sharing activities, and many research funders (e.g., Switzerland: SNSF; Europe: Horizon Europe; USA: NSF, NIH, DOE; Canada: CIHR, NSERC; Australia: ARC; South Africa: NRF; etc.) encourage sharing datasets openly. If approval is needed, please send this template explanation document to your Project Coordinator to facilitate the process:

➡️ Download: Data Sharing Amendment Template (available soon)

**What if I want to share my data now but publish it openly later?**

You will always have this right. If needed, you can place an **embargo** on your uploaded dataset until further notice. We recognize that some of your research projects and publications may still be in progress, which is why we’ve integrated this option into the contribution process. You retain full control over when and how your dataset becomes publicly visible. Just select one of the offered timelines or conditions for release when submitting your data. Temporary embargoing means that contributed dataset status remains private before the PDDL license takes effect.

**Can I withdraw my data from the database?**

Under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL), you dedicate your submitted data to the public domain. If you have the necessity to remove your data already published in the IAQ DB, we will assist you. However, retraction requests must be formalized based on legal issues or following the retraction of the related publication. Data already downloaded and used by end users cannot be retrieved.
