## Developing a Global Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Database

The rapid growth of smart building technologies is revolutionizing how we monitor and improve indoor air quality (IAQ). To support this transformation, we are building the first open-source **Global IAQ Database**—a curated, standardized repository of IAQ data from decades of field measurements around the world.

This initiative is led by the **[Human-Oriented Built Environment Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/hobel/) at EPFL** and supported by **[Swissuniversities – Programme Open Science](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en/topics/open-science/open-science-programme)**, as part of the **[ISIAQ Innovation Network](https://www.isiaq.org/developing_a_global_iaq_databa.php)**. The database is being developed in collaboration with [Charlotte Weil](https://people.epfl.ch/charlotte.weil) and [Yannick Marcon](https://people.epfl.ch/yannick.marcon) from [ENAC-IT4R, EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/enac/about/data-at-enac/enac-it4research/), who lead the technical implementation. Project partners include colleagues from the Technical University of Denmark, the University of Oulu, the French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), the University of Sydney, the University of Colorado, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Our shared goal is to make high-quality, harmonized indoor air quality (IAQ) data openly available to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners worldwide.

We invite contributors to share datasets from past and ongoing field campaigns. In return, contributors gain visibility and contribute to a global effort shaping future IAQ standards, health guidelines, and building policies.

Our approach:
* **Transforms existing IAQ datasets into a unified, high-value global resource**
* **Connects air quality data with building, occupant, climate, and contextual variables**
* **Ensures robust quality control and harmonization across diverse data sources**
* **Provides user-friendly tools for data exploration, access, and download**

Join us in this global effort to unlock the full potential of IAQ data for healthier, more sustainable indoor environments!
